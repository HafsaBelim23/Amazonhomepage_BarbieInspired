# Amazonhomepage_BarbieInspired
A CSS-based web page that draws inspiration from Amazon's iconic Home Page, but with a delightful Barbie theme! With the current surge in Barbie movie popularity, I saw this as the perfect chance to showcase my creativity and skills.

Throughout the development process, I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. All the logos and images used were meticulously designed by me using Canva, ensuring a unique and eye-catching aesthetic. The core structure of the web page is built upon HTML and CSS, resulting in a visually appealing and responsive layout.

In the coming days, I plan to further enhance this project by implementing additional functionalities through JavaScript. This will undoubtedly elevate the user experience and add even more interactivity to the page.
